Hi, my name is David.
I'm a junior full stack developer with 4 years experience in IT sales and technology recruitment.

My previous career has taught me to talk about complex or technical projects and ideas in a way that both technical and non-technical stakeholders can follow.

I am really keen to explore my future career as a developer. What draws me to technology and coding is the idea that there are endless possibilities to create something. I am driven by focussed and creative people with a desire to succeed in whatever it is they are pursuing.
